Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for
several types of word analysis.
Using your preferred language/framework, create your own algorithm that reads
a text file and counts the frequency of words in the given text. Then it
counts words and characters, and also constructs a histogram displaying the
words and the frequency.
